                <p>an old car named <span class="cadillac">"1949 Cadillac Convertible" </span> Don Walker has been involved with cars his whole life and has owned and worked on too many to count from concours quality restorations to hot rods and customs. When he was ready to build his latest project, there were three rules that had to be followed. It had to be classic in design, it had to be updated and new under the skin, and it had be a convertible.
                Don was 14 years old when his father came home with a 1957 Chevy that he'd purchased on a whim. It became a father-and-son project, as they rebuilt the engine, brakes, electrical system, and other components of the car. That buildup instilled in Don his lifelong love for classic cars and taught him how to persevere toward a goalâ€”values that paid off with every car he's built ever since, and especially with his most recent.
